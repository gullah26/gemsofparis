## Deployment

### Deployment to Heroku

This project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Below is a step by step deployment process:

1. Go to Heroku website and register as user
2. Create a new app
3. Navigate to the "Resources" tab and search for Heroku Postgres.
4. In order to use PostgreSQL, both packages `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2` have to be installed on Gitpod.
5. Import `dj_database_url` into the project's [`settings.py`](/gem_master/settings.py) to setup new database.
6. Disable the default database(SQLite) in the project's [`settings.py`](/gem_master/settings.py) and add the PostgreSQL database URL stored in the variable `DATABASE_URL`(can be found by clicking on the "settings" tab followed by clicking on "reveal config vars") in order to connect to PostgreSQL.
7. Run migrations (due to the use of PostreSQL) on Gitpod.

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

8. Load data (Categories and Products JSON files in the [`fixtures`](/products/fixtures) folder).
- Load categories first 

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py loaddata categories
    ```

- Then load products

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py loaddata products
    ```

9. Create superuser:

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser 
    ```

10. In the project's [`settings.py`](/gem_master/settings.py), re-enable the projec's default database(disabled in step number 5) and with an if statment make sure that when the app is running on Heroku the connection is made to PostgreSQL or otherwise to default database (SQLite).
11. Install `gunicorn` package on Gitpod
12. Create Procfile
13. Set `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` to `1` on Heroku (so heroku does not collect static files during deployment).

    ```
    $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app gem-master
    ```

14. Add `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable(containing host name of the premiumbody app and the localhost) to project's [`settings.py`](/gem_master/settings.py) file.
15. Commit and Push to Github
16. Since the app was created via the Heroku webpage, initializing heroku git remote is necessary before pushing to Heroku

    ```
    $ heroku git:remote -a gem-master
    ```

17. Push to Heroku

    ```
    $ git push heroku master
    ```

18. Finally, enable automatic deployment to Heroku when pushing to Github by going to Heroku webpage, clicking on the "Deploy" tab and then on "Connect to Github" button. Search for the gem-master repo and click on "Connect". Scroll down to the "Automatic deploys" section and click on "Enable Automatic Deploys".
